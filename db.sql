I would like to ask for your support for a proposed visit of no more than 3 of my students in the week beginning 15th November 2010. It is a key aim of the course (User and Carer Expectations of Health and Social Care) that our students appreciate the scope and value of the support the SYCP offers. A number of students visited about the same time last year - and gave very positive feedback. I am trying to be a bit more organised this year, realising that you are likely to be very busy.\r\nThe purpose of the students’ visit would be to gather information about the support that is available to families at or via the SYCP. Afterwards, back in the classroom, they will then be expected to pool their knowledge with that accumulated by students who shall be visiting the Weston Park Cancer Information and Support Centre and the Princess Royal Trust Carers Centre.\r\n I would expect that any visit would take no more than an hour or so. Clearly, any visit would need to be tailored to the resources you have available. My preferred option, at this stage, is for the students to visit between 1.30 and 3.30 on 15th November 2010 – as this is their normal classroom time. However, it may be possible to find another timeslot in that week. \r\n\r\n\r\nCould you please give this proposal your consideration and let me know what you think? Of course, please contact me for any further information. Many thanks. I look forward to hearing from you.  \r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nDavid.','2010-08-04 13:53:22','2010-08-04 13:53:22'),(183,39,'address','sheffield city council, new bank house, po box 1918, s1 2xx','2010-08-24 11:28:34','2010-08-24 11:28:34'),(184,39,'name','syed rizvi','2010-08-24 11:28:34','2010-08-24 11:28:34'),(185,39,'i_am_a','My work brings me into contact with young carers','2010-08-24 11:28:34','2010-08-24 11:28:34'),(186,39,'email_address','syed.rizvi@sheffield.gov.uk','2010-08-24 11:28:34','2010-08-24 11:28:34'),(187,39,'message','I am part of a group supporting the Sheffield Safeguarding Childrens Board.

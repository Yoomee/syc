TramlinesEnquire
================

To create a new enquiry form, simply create a new partial named after the form you wish to use,
for example a 'Contact' form, create '_contact_form.html.haml'.

Add the form fields to this view and customize as desired. 

Modify or create the 'tramlines_enquire.yml' file in the config folder. Add the details of the name, email address and response. E.g;
  name: contact
  email_to: email@address.com
  response: Thank you for your enquiry. We will be in touch shortly.
